    There is a long-debated, deeply entrenched gap  in the foundations of the project of naturalization of semantics and mental content: a gap between so-called semantic information and Shannon information. The gap has had a wide influence in cognitive science since the first applications of information theory to neuroscience (\cite{mackay_limiting_1952}) and in epistemology since Dretske (\cite{dretske_knowledge_1981}).

    Godfrey-Smith and Sterelny (2008), as well as Piccinini and Scarantino (2011), recognize two separate kinds of information: Shannon information and semantic information.

        ... and they may intersect. 
    My claim is that there is ony one kind of information, what solves the gap problem, (but many qustions remain reformulated )

\begin{frame}
    The gap is a symptom of a bigger theoretical explosion, which is not only a problem for cognitive science, but also for philosophy of mind and philosophy of language. 

    The goal of this presentation is to show that there is only one kind of information, and that the gap can be bridged by a suitable mechanism, which I will call "Shannon pipeline".

THIS I STHE PICTURE OF THE THEORIRESS OF INFORMATION 
(pieczarki)

    This gap is  one of the big class 

PLATON: (eidos ), late informing  : in-formare - order / structure  preserving ; no measure

 HARTLEY  first gave the idea that connects the quantity of information with probability and strech it because its huge with log function. Notice Hartleys big idea was to get rid of psychological notion of inforamtion!!! MEanwhile we ended with "surpise" and "uncertainty" in  textbooks, which is a  problem for cognitive science (circularity)

    "SHANNON" Information (This is not his fault, that we call it so; he woould not :-) 
    NATURAL MEANING/INFORMATION (started by Grice (fire-smoke / shop is "OPEN"))
    NONNATURAL MEANING/INFORMATION  (conventions, may misrepresent)
    NATURAL as probability changing observation ($P(Y|X) > P(X) $)
    NATURAL KNOWLEDGE (Drestke $P(X)$ raises to $1$ after observation $Y$:  $P(Y|X) $) 
    SCARANTINO: The Probabilistic Difference Maker 
    STRONGLY SEMANTIC INFORMATION (Floridi): True information  (and its way of measuring)
BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION (DNA vehicles, it has causal capacities in the process of protein production )
MENTAL REPRESENTATION (task function: "standing for", but what is the case of fictional objects(?), structural and compositional representaion )
SEMANTIC INFORMATION (proposed be  Carnap  Bar-Hillel, measured by  ratio of number of worlds where sentence is true to number of worlds )

    NEURAL INFORMATION (measured by Shannonn tools (mutual, relative informatoin))

Just mention problems with particular solutions above.

    it is especially important for us because it is hoped that it can stand for the representation ; esp. structural representation
    which has some crucial properties for reps:
        -have aboutness 
        - can misrepresent
        -is drirected to its target (not symmetric)
        -has consumers that act upon them

show simmilarities

Floridi truthful-information (cant misrepresent?)
NONSEMANTIC INFORAMTION (PICCININIC)
FUNCTIONAL INFORAMTION  (FRESCO)

    FIlling it shows also how to get rid of other and finally stop inventing nek kinds of information and new kinds of its theories


\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Shannon Entropy =  Shannon Variability}

    1. There is no such thing as Shannon information. There is Shannon model of comminication.
    What does it do? It function task is rebiable transfer of information (not Shannon information)

    2.  Shannon entropy is quite often inaccurately described as uncertainty, knowledge, lack of knowledge, or disorder. The long stroy short: it is related with the fact, that entropy estimates the number of questions (binary, yes / no) that we need to ask to get the answer about the state of the world, given a distribution of objects in the world, to identify the state. That is however a psychlogical interpretation of Shannon entropy, which is not necessary for the inforamtion theory to work.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Shannon entropy, expressed as $- \sum p_i \log p_i$, is fundamentally understood as measuring the variability of the elements within a given distribution. 
        \item It characterizes the degree of diversity or how much variation can be found within a collection of objects.
        \item This interpretation aligns with the view that entropy measures variability, as emphasized by Carcassi (\cite{carcassi_variability_2021}).
        \item Information, then, is a state of a collection (of \textbf{any} objects).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame} {First pillar: Carcassi interpretation of entropy}

Entropy is "variability of the elements within a given distribution", what gives it "a crisp intuitive meaning that is general and applicable to all branches of science" (\cite{carcassi_variability_2021}).

In this interpretaions ONCE for all we ca chop of the whole branch of problems related to seeing Shannon theory as nonstarter for the foundation of explanantions in cognitive scienc  cognitive science

(Bickhard, P)

and also get rid of ccircularities in psychological notion of "uncertainty", pervasive in textbooks of IT.

This interpuding retation is extremely valuable because we can use it in all science, but esp. in cogntitive science without a worry about homunculus, circularity, epistemological circularity etc

For exampple animal signalling can be described thist way as as reacting on the variablilityby the pipeline reslting in behavior (vervet but albo cnidarians. żebropławy )
No more talking anbout codes, where it does not fit or leads to "Bickhard's" antiencodingism. 

non-psychological interpretation: we do not say anymore in any substantial way about (average) surprisal / uncertainty of event.
Variability interpretations is better starter fo cog sci interpretatons.
 

\end{frame}



\begin{frame} {First (quntifiable) information flow model (Shannon)}
    "Information flow" - how does it work?
    How did first model of communication work?
    Ask in the new mechanistic way: what are the parts, what do they do and (teleological part) what is the task of the pipeline

    REPETITION CODE AND MAJORITY VOTE - functions of encoder and decoder 
    Function of the whole mechanism: reliable transmission of information (collection)
    Order preserving come from the construction.
    Lack of order preserving (FIFOin this case) during transmission  be equal 
    So the momment of creating the communicatioon model there is order preserving involved.
     
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{A suitable cognitive Shannon pipeline for cognitive sciences explanations}
    
  

    A cognitive pipeline suitable for cognitive science explanations should then to get its job done, after Gałdziejewski Miłkowski,  satisfy several criteria:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Non-circular interpretation:} Following Carcassi's variability interpretation, avoiding psychological notions of "uncertainty" or "surprise" that lead to explanatory circularity.
        
        \item \textbf{Biological plausibility:} The pipeline components should map onto identifiable neural or neuroendocrine mechanisms and processes.
        
       
        
        \item \textbf{Error tolerance:} Real biological systems operate in noisy environments and must maintain functionality despite imperfect transmission.
        
        \item \textbf{Compositional capability:} The pipeline should support operations that enable complex representations to be built from simpler components.
         
        \item \textbf{Structure preservation:} Beyond mere correlation, the pipeline must preserve relevant structural relationships from input to output.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Key insight:} The standard Shannon model provides the foundation, but requires extensions (like the proposed noisy addition) to bridge the gap to semantic information processing in cognitive systems.

    
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}

    HOW SHOULD IT LOOK LIKE 
    source: real external or internal variabilites (can conatin "real patterns")
    the encoder - some kind of processing the input variability
    the channel - any influence from external or internal environment (a black box, really)
    the decoder - some kind of processing the input variability "down the stream"
    the receiver - can be counted as part of pipeline or not

    Examples (sunlight, alge, movements)
    Vervets signalling

    This is also an implementation model of pushme-pullyou of the representation posited by Millikan
    (\cite{millikan_pushme-pullyou_2017}).

    What is the algea doing in this 2 seconds after sun?

\begin{frame} {COins in the pocket setup}
    \begin{center}
        Correlations can be perfectly accidental and still carry natural information
        Pipelines can have multiple sources.
        Pipeleines can be branched.
        
        Draw the example of pipelines in case of the "Coins in the pocket setup"

        
        This kind of setup is multiplied and  combined in social networks, which explains Dennets Trafalgar square exaple: it shows "the channel" of his interest as branches structed of causally connected elements, sources, senders, receivers.

    \end{center}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Early neural systems as information pipelenes}

 Jekely stresses out hybrid IO + IC pipeleines (\cite{jekely_neural_2013}): 
    "The neural system of the cnidarian Hydra is a simple, yet functional, nervous system that can be described as a hybrid input-output and input-computation system. It is composed of a network of neurons that can process and transmit information, allowing for complex behaviors such as swimming and feeding." - XXX Check this

    \textbf{Neurons in the pipeline:}

When neurons appear in the evolution is unclear, bu given the Jekely charcterization they 
have "direction" either manytoone one to many 

Both solutions can be useful
show how (entropy in classification)
branching in steering 

both pipelines can be achieved from mere one-dimensional copiers (like Shannon communication model)

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{My claims for today}
    
    \begin{center}
        
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Applications of Shannon's information theory and communication model seem not only to be relevant (\cite{Mann2023}) but also useful (\cite{martinez_representations_2019}) for the naturalistic project of explaining mental content (mental representations).  
           
            \item Yet there is, I think, some gap between information theory capabilities and representation theory needs, only partially addressed by philosophers: the gap related to the compositionality of content. 
            \item If there is a gap, then the goal is to bridge it \textbf{without positing a new kind of information}  and \textbf{show that there is only one kind, though mechanisms processing information can differ enormously}. 
        
            \item I also propose a mechanism that seems to show the way to  bridge the gap.

\begin{frame} {Representations in the information theory: a way that I won't choose today}
        
    Small disclaimer. 
    Originally, Dretske required the necessity of conditional probabilitity for representation (\cite{Dretske1981}), which is unrealistic in a noisy world: representations often misrepresent. On the other hand, simply raising the conditional probability of a stimulus given a representation is too weak to establish a representational relation between random variables $X_i$ and $Y_j$: it brings indeterminacy of content as immediate problem.   Additionally, mutual information $I(X_i;Y_j)$ is symmetric. \textbf{These consequences seem a bit unrealistic. Hint: original Dretske's setup lacks crucial parts of the Shannon's pipeline.}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame} {What does "semantic" mean, roughly}
    \begin{center}
        Sematnicity is a property of representations (words, images, maps) that are about something, that have "aboutness" or "intentionality" (in the sense of Brentano, \cite{brentano_psychology_1995}) - but in a distinguished way.

        Tarski (who inspired Carnap invastigation of language meaning conceived as sets of functions from possible worlds to truth values)
        Tarski defined truth using
        -  terms that refer to domain 
        - logic constants (e.g. "and", "or", "not"), quantifiers
        - recursive rules of constructing thet properly build formulas such that what they refer to is a function of the referntial terms and logical constants.
        
        That kind of buolding sets of languae representatoins of a domain; which are systematically related : their values depend only on the values of the referential terms and logical constants used in them.


    \end{center}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Semantic information and its vehicles}
 
We know well many examples of vehicles of semantic information:
 
Obvious cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item true sentences (e.g. "The cat is on the mat" refering to the state of the world)
    \item maps of domains (e.g. terrain).
    \item photos and pictures, paintings.
\end{itemize}

Controvertial cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item false sentences
    \item distorted images
    \item empty descriptions (e.g. "the king of France")
   
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\color{red} Three important comments here:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All these cases "derive" or "inherit" their semantic information from mental content ("non-natural information"). 
   \item For sake of simplicity, I will equate them with structural representations (below)
    \item They are not only structural, but in most cases compositional.
\end{itemize}

 \end{frame}


 \begin{frame}{Conditions on structural representaions and its vehicles}

    Structural representations should meet the job description (\cite{ramsey_representation_2007}) for representations (\cite{gladziejewski_explaining_2015-1,gladziejewski_structural_2017}). 
 
     \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{Structural Similarity Condition:} The component part of the mechanism (the representational vehicle) should have a structural resemblance to the object it represents. 
         Important: misrepresetation is always  possible, because similarity comes in degrees.
         
         \item \textbf{Action-Guidance Condition:} The representation must guide the actions of the larger cognitive system.
         
         \item \textbf{Decouplability Condition:} The representation should be able to function even when the object it represents is not present.
         
         \item \textbf{Error-Detection Condition:} The system using the representation must have the ability to detect when the representation is inaccurate or false. 
     \end{itemize}

 
 \end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Similarity can be well defined }
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Similarity is a crucial aspect of representation, ensuring that the essential relationships and properties of the represented domain are maintained in the representing domain. 
        
        \item Similarity can be defined with the concept of homomorphism, which is a mapping that preserves the structure of set of objects and its map. Another way is defining similarity by abstract distance between some objects (e.g. strings "000000" and "00010" are quite similar, but not equal). This kind of similarity can be measured and is very natural in Shannon's theory toolkit.
       
        \item In the context of representation, homomorphisms ensure that the representing domain accurately reflects the structure of the represented domain, allowing for  inferences and predictions. 
    
  
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Shannon information and its vehicles}

   The interesting cases of the vehicles of Shannon information are:
    \begin{itemize}
       
        \item binary strings (e.g. sequences of bits)
        \item words (e.g. in a newspaper)
        \item DNA sequences 
        \item waggle dance of honeybees
        \item neural spike trains (or some other aspects of bioelectric activity of neurons)
       
        \item ..any collections of any objects have information-theory properties such as entropy,and mutual information with some (other) collection. 
        
        
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame} { Shannon information and its vehicles (a very short intro) }
   
   Since Hartley (\cite{hartley_transmission_1928})  we can think about information as a non-psychological, quantifiable aspect of groups of objects, that could be carried or stored or transmitted or processed whatever these objects are. 

Shannon  extended Hartley’s approach, and introduced a statistical concept of entropy to measure this property. To compute the entropy of  the collection, we need only to know the distribution of it, that is the probabilities of elements in the collection.



\end{frame}


\begin{frame} { Shannon informtion and its vehicles (a very short intro) cont. }
The entropy of $X$ is defined as:
$$
H(X) = -\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) \log_2 p(x)
$$

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H(X)$ is the entropy of the random variable $X$.
    \item $\mathcal{X}$ is the set of all possible values of $X$.
    \item $x$ is a specific value of $X$.
    \item $p(x)$ is the probability of $X$ taking the value $x$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{"It measures the variability of the elements within a given distribution, giving it a crisp intuitive meaning that is general and applicable to all branches of science"} \cite{carcassi_variability_2021} 

The amount of Shannon information is then a statistical property of its vehicles.

    \end{center}

    \bigskip
    
    There is an abundance of arguments for the existence of more than one kind of information, here I will recall three of them.


\end{frame}

\begin{frame} {Levels of Organisation / Leibniz's mill argument} 
   
    \begin{itemize}
    
        
      \item  Rathkopf calls this state of affairs a bifurcation: "At a high level of neural organization, brain information is semantic, but down at the level of single neurons, semantic properties are irrelevant, and the only information to speak of is Shannon information."  (\cite{rathkopf_what_2020})
      
     
    \end{itemize}
      
  
  \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dennett's Trafalgar Square Argument}
    
    Dennett provides a toy model to illustrate the gap (\cite{dennett_bacteria_2017}): 
    
    "Jacques shoots his uncle dead in Trafalgar Square and is apprehended on the spot by Sherlock. Tom reads about it in the Guardian, and Boris learns of it in Pravda.\textbf{ Jacques, Sherlock, Tom, and Boris have had remarkably different experiences, but they share one thing: semantic information that a Frenchman has committed a murder in Trafalgar Square.} (...) They share no encoding, but they do share semantic information."

    \bigskip
    
    \begin{quote}
    "Semantic information, the concept of information that we must start with, is remarkably independent of encodings, in the following sense: two or more observers can acquire the same semantic information from encounters that share no channel" ()\cite{dennett_bacteria_2017}). 
    \end{quote}

    I will argue below that "seeing" these channels is a ambitious, open scientific project.

\end{frame}






\begin{frame}{Argument from Equal Entropy}
  Two different distributions can have the same Shannon entropy, $H(X)$, even if their internal structures differ significantly. 

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/entropia_1.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/entropia_2.png}
\end{center}
   The first receptive field may represent tasty food that some  fish could eat. Second is rather only a dirt! So the information first differs from the information in second one.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Argument from Equal Entropy (cont.)}    
       
This argument is flawed in at least two respects.

First, whats is equal, is only the measure (entropy). Cf. a glass of water can carry the same amout of water as a bottle.    Shannon entropy captures the variability or uncertainty of a distribution but \textbf{does not capture the specific arrangement or structure of the data}.


    So the collorary is mistaken: it is not the case that there is a new kind of information, but rather that we should look for mechanism preserving order  or internal structure.

    E.g. in retina this order may be preserved just by spatial encoding that is then encoded by time relations between spikes

   


\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{The core of information theory}
Shannon information theory is more than Dretske  first used when starting his program of naturalizing knowledge.  
    \textbf{Crucially, it posits a mechanism called famously "Shannon communication model".}  This model has a task function.

“The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing
at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at
another point.” (\cite{shannon_mathematical_1948})
\textbf{
Shannon model's task function, we mights say, is  optimizing reliabilty of transfer. What ELSE it is able to perform, is an open question}
    
Information theory has the communication model in its ontological commitments. When applied, the model equates to a kind of mechanism or is a part of bigger mechanism (in the sense of New Mechanists, \cite{machamer_thinking_2000,glennan_rethinking_2002}).
    
    Probably the best way to think about this mechanism is in terms of "information processing pipeline" (\cite{martinez_representations_2019}).
    Two of its 5 parts (encoder and decoder) are allowed to process information in any way that improves reliability of transmission of information.

    Importantly, this is a abstract mechanism description that we can map on many biological phenomena, organs, parts of organisms etc. But this practce is problematic (Nizami \cite{nizami_information_2019}).

    3 main theorems in the core of the information theory  relate to  different parts of the model: these are source coding theorem, channel coding theorem, and rate distortion theorem. They describe COMPRESSION  RATE LIMITs (resp. lossless transmission, lossy compression, and trade off between rate and distortion) of the communication model.

Encoder and decoder are  machines performing some algorithms  in the given implementation.
The elements of the pipeline are then in \textbf{causal relations.} ("Cheap correlations" allegations can be then dismissed, if we are sure about the causal relations between the elements of the pipeline - if they are established independently)

    The whole pipepeline is also a machine, a stochastic one, when a channel is noisy.
    {$\hat{X}$} predicts or guesses the value of $X$.

\begin{frame}{Shannon model as mechanism}
 
    The classic Shannon channel is a mechanism in this sense.
    According to the New Mechanists:

    Mechanisms are entities and activities organized in such a way that they are
    productive of regular changes from start or set-up to finish or termination conditions.
    (...)
    Mechanisms are composed of both entities (with their properties) and
    activities. Activities are the producers of change. Entities are the things
    that engage in activities. (\cite{machamer_thinking_2000})

    
    "A mechanism underpinning a behavior is a complex system that produces
    that behavior by the interaction of a number of parts, where the
    interactions between parts can be characterized by direct, invariant,
    change-relating generalizations." (\cite{glennan_rethinking_2002})

        \item \textbf{Structural Similarity Condition - } The Shannon model inherently preserves the {\color{red} probabilistic structure} of the source and the transmitted signal, ensuring a degree of resemblance between the input and output.
        \item \textbf{Action-Guidance Condition - } The encoded and transmitted information carried by parts-vehicles of the model can guide actions in systems that  utilize the signal, such as neural networks.
        \item \textbf{Decouplability Condition -} The Shannon model allows for the transmission or storage of information independently of the presence of  source, enabling decoupled representations (hallucinations are possible and can be common). 
        \item \textbf{Error-Detection Condition -} The original Shannon model implements mechanism for error correction by design.

    Multiple use of channel is assumed with no relation between elements of the sequence transmitted (for generality of Shannon theorems). Real world sources produce ordered signals.

\begin{frame} {Why order is  preserved on this conditions in the transmission at all?}

    This is simply a consequence of the construction of the channel!

    Shannon model processes the elements of sequences \textbf{"first in, first out"}, thus saving their order.

    So, if some order can be transferred, can there be homomorphisms achived?     And if we have hoomorphisms, we can have compositionality?

    \begin{frame} {It is not an easy task to see the Shannon channel}
    
        Now we may go back to Dennets argument for a while. Good mechanistic explanations should be able to map the elements of Shannon model on the cognitive pipelines. 
     
     The 3M requirement (\cite{kaplan_explanatory_2011-1} ) holds that for a model to count as a proper mechanistic explanation (as opposed to just a phenomenological description), it must satisfy two core conditions:
     
     The variables in the model must correspond to identifiable components, activities, and organizational features of the actual mechanism that produces, maintains, or underlies the phenomenon.
     
     The dependencies or relations posited among these variables in the model must correspond to causal relations among the components of the target mechanism
     
     But there is no consensus in neuroscience how to map them!   Cf.  Nizami's critique and his table from hell \cite{nizami_information_2019}
     He estimates the number of possible mappings of the Shannon model on the organisms for thousands.

"Compositionality is all around us " \autocite{coecke_mathematical_nodate}

Somewhat paradoxically, most natural domain for compositionality are artificial laaguages (after Frege). Natural language includes many counterexamples (e.g. "red herring")

\begin{quote}
The meaning of a compound expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and of the syntactic rule by which they are combined (\cite{janssen_compositionality_2012,janssen_frege_2001})
\end{quote} 
Compositionality is a general property of \textbf{complex} representational systems, but not only languages:

It is essential for linear algebra on multidimensional spaces:
\begin{itemize}
   
    \item \textbf{Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition:} For all scalars $c$ and all vectors $u$ and $v$ in $V$, $c(u + v) = cu + cv$.
    \item \textbf{Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to scalar addition:} For all scalars $c$ and $d$ and all vectors $v$ in $V$, $(c + d)v = cv + dv$.
\end{itemize} (\cite{axler_linear_2024})


We can also think of source sequences this way: we model world with linear algebra in science.

    The smallest building blocks of most of the  networks (artificial neurons) use  linear algebra and compute sums of weighted inputs, which is a linear, compositional  operation.    
    
    \textbf{To fit them in the Shannon model picture let us assume that the incoming elements of a sequence are ordered} - as in binary code.  The sequences of objects from the alphabet set \(\{0,1\}\) in the input signal are then ordered from the most important to the least important (or from the strongest to the weakest). In this binary sequence, the first bit is the most important or the strongest, and the last bit is the least important or the weakest, with the \((n-1)\)-th element being two times weaker than the \(n\)-th element. 

For example, the sequence:
\[
a_{1..4} = 1011

\[
2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 11.

   Barlow hypothesized that the spikes in the sensory system formed a neural code for efficiently representing sensory information. \textbf{By efficient, Barlow meant that the code minimized the number of spikes needed to transmit a given signal.}

    Distributional semantics: A word's meaning is given by the words that frequently appear close by (context)

    "You shall know a word by the company it keeps" (J. R. Firth 1957: 11)
    One of the most successful ideas in modern statistical NLP.
    When a word $w$ appears in a text, its context is the set of words that appear nearby (within a fixed-size window).

    Word2vec models (\cite{mikolov2013a}) are in fact weights of neural nets trained to recognize similar words as close vectors in multidimensional vector space.

\begin{frame}{Traits of compositionality:  Mikolov effect and  analogies of predicates}

   Word models show that meaning (i.e linguistic representation) can be represented as points in multidimensional vector spaces, and whats more, complex meanings can be predicted from simple meanings by means of vector arithmetic (linear algebra)
    Consider the above approximation of meaning relation (\cite{mikolov2013a}):
   \huge $$\text{king} - \text{man} + \text{woman} \approx \text{queen}.$$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mikolov effect}

   
       
   \textbf{ Mikolov effect suggests that word embeddings space has linear and thus compositional properties}, as we can predict meaning of complex expressions from the meanings of their parts.
  

    What is the explanation of this effect?
    This effect is, I think,  due to  compositionality of meaning in vector spaces, where the meaning of a complex expression can be derived from the meanings of its parts and the way they are combined.
\textbf{
    But what is the scaffolding for this compositionality? How could it be achieved in the Shannon model? }
    
    I propose the construction that partly shows how linearity can be achieved in the Shannon model.

\begin{frame}{A proposal for Noisy Addition pipeline model }
   
\textbf{How can computaional model acuire linear capabilities by exploting the Shannon model pipeline?}
    
Let me now propose that the "mutated" or "exapted" Shannon channel can perform computation: specifically, (noisy) addition without relying on traditional arithmetic operations. Why choose addition? 

Having addition, system could gain the task function of "measuring intensity," which leads to thresholding units (\cite{mcculloch_logical_1943}) and, consequently, to classification capabilities and linear properties in the system.

Consider two channels \(\Gamma_1\) and \(\Gamma_2\) present in an agent—say, a worm \(S\). Together, they transmit signals from the frontal part to the rear motor part of the worm. The signals are transmitted as binary sequences.


\[
S \underset{\text{code}}{\mapsto} A \rightarrow \boxed{\Gamma_1} \rightarrow B \underset{\text{decide}}{\mapsto} \Delta(B) \underset{\text{decode}}{\mapsto} S
\]

\[
S \underset{\text{code}}{\mapsto} A \rightarrow \boxed{\Gamma_2} \rightarrow B \underset{\text{decide}}{\mapsto} \Delta(B) \underset{\text{decode}}{\mapsto} S
\]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A proposal for noisy addition model (cont.) }

\textbf{Now, suppose the channel \(\Gamma_2\) breaks—its receiver fails.} 

The exapted model is now represented as follows:

\[
S \underset{\text{code}}{\mapsto} A \rightarrow \boxed{\Gamma_1} \rightarrow B \underset{\text{decide}}{\mapsto} \Delta(B) \underset{\text{decode}}{\mapsto} S
\]

\[
S \underset{\text{code}}{\mapsto} 
A 
\begin{tikzpicture}[overlay, remember picture]
    \draw[->, red, thick] (0,0) to[out=90,in=200] (0.6,0.9);
\end{tikzpicture}
\textcolor{white}{\rightarrow }
\textcolor{lightgray}{\boxed{\Gamma_2} \rightarrow B \underset{\text{decide}}{\mapsto} \Delta(B) \underset{\text{decode}}{\mapsto} S}
\]

\textbf{Surprisingly, this pipeline is able to perform addition, with given noise. }

    \begin{frame}{Conclusions }
    
        \begin{itemize}
           \item To explain semantic phenomena is to provide a description of the pipeline that processes the variabilty (Carcassi),  what seems like proper scientific task with some prospect of successes.
          
            \item To explain  structural representations, only one kind of information is needed: "Shannon" information. When processed by complex pipelines (e.g., neural networks), it does not become  (1) semantic nor (2) compositional: the whole pipeline has this properties  and qualifies as an S-representation. Our ontology gets healtier. 
            
        \textbf{    c.f. John does not become car-ish when driving a car.}

            \item There is a mechanistic, biologically plausible transition from the original Shannon model to machine learning models such as classifiers (e.g. CNNs). I suggest the minimal improvemnt towards that kind of pipeline is the proposed here "noisy adder".
            
            \item Full, proper explanation of cognitive pipeline is a scientific project of finding the right model of the pipeline that processes the variability (Carcassi) and properly maps it's parts, following 3M rule (\cite{Craver}).
